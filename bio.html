            <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Farangis Sakhayee</strong>. I’m a software engineering student with a strong imaginative side. 
                Alongside coding, I love painting, drawing, crocheting, and crafting — creating things helps me express 
                what words sometimes can’t.

                I was born on March 20, 2001 (a Pisces ♓) and grew up in Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan, 
                until I was 14. Later, I moved to Istanbul, where I finished high school. I enjoy movies, music, and deep 
                conversations, and I’m someone who feels deeply, even if I don’t always show it easily.</p>
